    <p>As the president prepares for a televised speech to the leaders at the summit meeting, he thanks Snake and tells him that he can have anything he wants. All Snake wants to know is how the president feels about the people who died saving him. The president offers only half-hearted regret and lip service for their sacrifice. As Snake walks away in disgust, Hauk offers him a job as his deputy, but Snake just keeps walking. The president's live speech commences, and he plays the cassette tape. To his embarrassment, it only plays Cabbie's song, "Bandstand Boogie." As Snake continues to walk away, he unravels the real cassette tape, containing the president's intended message and deliberately shredding it.</p>

You just escaped from LA!</h2><img src="https://d2ycltig8jwwee.cloudfront.net/features/927/fullwidth.644efc9a.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 650px;"><p>The president orders Snake's execution, but Snake previously activated his hologram projector, and the Snake who gets shot is an illusion. Snake activates the real control device, entering the world code and ending all technological activity on the planet, against pleas to stop. At the deportation center, Utopia expresses her delight that Snake shut down the Earth and thus saved her. Snake lights a cigarette and blows out the match used to light it, uttering, "Welcome to the human race."</p></div>
